# tweetCky
Simple PHP application for users to tweet from.

This project is barely maintained, finished in about a day. Just wanted to create a cloud backup just in case I decide to take it further.

Utilizes [TwitterOAuth](https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth-com) by [Abraham](https://github.com/abraham)<br>
Use composer to install:
```
composer require abraham\twitteroauth
```
